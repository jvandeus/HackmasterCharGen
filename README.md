HackmasterCharGen
=================

A character generator for the tabletop role playing game called Hackmaster.

This is a program made using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and MySQL Connector. The aim was to make a program that utilized database technology. All of the character statistic modifiers and stats are kept on a database.

Status
=================
This project is not fully functional at the moment. It is a work-in-progress.

A database containing the data needed to run the program is currently not online. When set up properly using a simulated MySQL server, the program will allow you to roll the statistics for the character and chose a class.

Some form of functionality will be restored in the future, but for now, running the program would require the proper set up of MySQL connector C++ and database. If this is needed, let me know and i will do my best to facilitate.
